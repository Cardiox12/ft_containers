- Iterators :
    - Changed definitions in map iterator to match its internal data definition
    - Transformed random_access_iterator into bidirectional iterator
        - Removed unecessary function members (Arithmetic)

[Saturday 16 October]

- Iterators :
	- Add increment_ private function member
		(Will add decrement function next time)
- Map :
	- Add end
	- Add sentinel node
		- Add private function member create_sentinel_node
		- Add private function member set_sentinel
	- Refactor insert function member to add sentinel node to the rightmost node

[Sunday 17 October (Mai-Nhi Birthday)]

- Map : 
	- Add clear function member
	- Add delete
	- Refactor :
		- Move create_node functions into `rb_node` class as a static function members
		- Move sentinel util functions into `rb_node` class as function members
	- Add tests for insert function member
	- Add size function member

- Iterators : 
	- Modify operator->() to return data_const_reference instead of data_const_pointer


[Tuesday 19 October (Safae Birthday)]

- Map :
	- Add left sentinel
	- Refactor :
		- insert function member with left sentinel
		- begin function member with a constant access
		- rbegin function member with a constant access

- Iterator :
	- Add decrement private function member on all map iterators

[Wednesday 20 October]

- Map :
	- Add unit test for find function member

[Tuesday 23 November]

- Map :
	- Clear :
		- Refactor clear so that it does not destroy sentinel node
	- Erase :
		- Change setting of children nodes because children wasn't setting their parent
